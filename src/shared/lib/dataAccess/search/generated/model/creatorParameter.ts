Due to historic reasons and evolutions in the id management systems, a user identifier can be one of: a UUID (for creators that had an UiTiD v1), an Auth0 user id (for new UiTiD v2 creators), or in some very old cases even an email address or nickname. (No new events or places are created with an email address or nickname as creator.) Can also be a client id suffixed with `@clients` in the case of results created with a client access token instead of a user access token.
