 * Returns only results that are related to the given location id (= place id). A place's id can be extracted from its URI by taking all the characters after the last `/`. For example for the URI `https://io.uitdatabank.be/place/75573a64-ddc8-4fd0-8b07-d258939dd74f` the id is `75573a64-ddc8-4fd0-8b07-d258939dd74f`. Note that while it will be a UUID in most cases, it is not guaranteed to always be one!
